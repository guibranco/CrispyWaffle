# Custom IoC Container Tests

This directory contains tests for the custom IoC container implementation.

## Tests

- `CustomIoCTests.cs`: Contains unit tests to verify the correct registration and resolution of services using different lifecycles (transient, singleton).

- `ServiceImplementation.cs`: Provides a simple service interface and implementation used in the tests.

## Running Tests

Use a test runner compatible with xUnit to execute the tests and verify the functionality of the custom IoC container.
